Oral chemotherapy is taken in the form of a pill and is used by stay-at-home patients while eliminating the need for the continuous aid of nurses and doctors. To ensure that the users take correct pills at the designated times, a 3D printed pill container was designed and built. This device also ensures the quality of the drugs by measuring the temperature.
